TechEd 2019 DAT312: Developing and Deploying a Machine Learning Scenario for SAP HANA

This hands-on session introduces developers on how to 
- create a __machine learning scenario__ using the __Python Machine Learning client for SAP HANA__ from within a Jupyter Notebook. 
You will create a HANA ML classification model using the Predictive Analysis Library-Random Decision Tree algorithm from within python. You will investigate how the Python client API generates SQL instructions, which can be re-used to build a ML scenario SAP HANA design-time artefact driven applications.
- __develop a SAP HANA native application__ containing the __machine learning scenario__.  
You will learn how to import and build a SAP HANA database application-project for a given ML scenario and specifically learn about the HANA design-time artefacts and structures needed for a HANA ML scenario composing a deployable / transportable application. Based on a template project, you will build a ML scenario project containing train-, fit-, debrief-, predict-, audit- and monitor-procedure examples, including their embedding into common design-time components like flowgraphs or calculation views.
- __deploy the machine learning scenario SAP HANA application__  
You will learn how to generate and deploy a SAP HANA database application project using the XSA client command line tools.
